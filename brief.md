Projekt-Nr. 7 
# Trivia Quiz

Create a simple, fun Online Quiz that holds a lot of questions and answers about a variety of topics, in a database. The Quiz is easy to test and play with.

HTML5, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS3

## Frameworks
Web and mobile developper

## Project context
You want to learn trivial facts about geography, biology, zoology, languages etc. with the help of an Online Quiz.

## Learning methods
You work solo as Web Developer and with Trainer guidance. Build the following pages (please, not everything in one single page):

Start/Home page index.php that introduces the Trivia Quiz and allows to select a topic and then start the Quiz with 12 to 15 questions
The question.php page (question text, instruction, answer-1, answer-2 etc.) completely filled from database
report.php page

Plan and implement navigation buttons for simple use and testing.

Plan, organize and build the website, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, PHP, PDO, phpMySQL and JavaScript. Then use VS Code, Docker, Git/GitHub for developing and source control. Use Figma for the Mockup.

See the output of your project as a prototype development - a perfect or fancy layout is secondary :-)

Finish your project at 12:30 of the 1st February. If possible, we will organize a vernissage of the quizzes.
